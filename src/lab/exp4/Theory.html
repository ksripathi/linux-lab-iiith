<h1 class="text-h2-lightblue">4. File Permissions</h1><div class="content" id="experiment-article-section-3-content">
<p>
	      Note that throughout this experiment word
	      'file' has been used to indicate all types of
	      files including regular files and
	      directories. Linux also has other types of
	      files, description of which is outside the
	      scope of this lab. If a particular statement
	      is true only for regular file or directory but
	      not for both then this would be mentioned
	      specifically.
	    </p>
<h3>Ownership: User owner, Group owner and
	      Others</h3>
<h3>User owner</h3>
<p>
	      The understanding of Linux file permissions
	      requires an understanding of various types of file
	      ownership.  In Linux all files have a user owner
	      and a group owner.  The user who creates a
	      particular file becomes its owner automatically.
	      Later another user can be made the owner of a file
	      by changing file's ownership.  Thus, by modifying
	      ownership any file can be owned by any Linux user.
	    </p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>
	      Multiple users can be grouped together in a
	      user-group.  There is no limit on the number of
	      users that can be part of a group.  It is even
	      possible to have a Linux group with zero
	      users. 
	    </p>
<p>
	      To grant access to a file to more than one user
	      groups are necessary.  To allow more than one user
	      to access to a file, all the required users are
	      made part of a same user-group.  Then the group
	      owner of the file is changed to the newly created
	      group.  This allows all the members belonging to
	      the group which owns the file to access the file
	      while restricting others from doing so.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Note that it is possible for a user to belong to
	      many different groups.  A user always belongs to
	      at least one special group called 'primary group'.
	      Apart for this primary group, the user can also
	      belong to any number of additional groups, called
	      secondary groups.
	    </p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>
	      The following example can be used to understand
	      afore mentioned points properly.  Consider a Linux
	      system with files: english.txt, maths.txt,
	      physics.txt, marks.txt and students.txt as shown
	      in Figure 1.
	    </p>
<p style="text-align:center">

<span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
		1: </span> Files used in Example 1.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Also assume that the system under consideration
	      has following teachers as users: english_teacher,
	      maths_teacher, physics_teacher and principal as
	      shown it Figure 2.  The system also has student
	      users such as student_a, student_b and student_c
	      as shown in Figure 3.
	    </p>

	    </p>
<h3>Example 1 - Requirement 1</h3>
<p>
	      As part of this example let us consider a
	      requirement where subject teachers' need access to
	      files of their subjects.  Thus english_teacher
	      needs access to english.txt, maths_teacher needs
	      access to maths.txt and physics_teacher needs
	      access to physics.txt.  This requirement is shown
	      with the help of Figure 4 below.
	    </p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="media/teacher_subject.svg" style="width:583px"/><br/>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Figure
		4: </span> Teachers needs access to files of their
	      subject.
	    </p>
<p>
	      This requirement is easy to satisfy by making
	      respective teachers the user owners of the files
	      of their subjects.  Thus, if user owners for the
	      files are set as shown in Table 1 below, then the
	      above mentioned requirement would get satisfied.
	    </p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<table border="1" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%">

</div>
<h3>Example 1: Requirement 2</h3>
<p>
	      Another requirement can be that all teachers need
	      access to marks.txt file.  This requirement can be
	      satisfied by keeping all teachers in a group, say
	      teachers, and then by making group owner of file
	      marks.txt to be group 'teacher'.  This particular
	      requirement and its solution are explained with
	      the help of Figures 5, 6 and Table 2.
	    </p>

<p>
	      Thus basic access requirements where only one user
	      needs access to a file or where a set of users
	      need access to a file, can be satisfied by using
	      users and groups, and by changing user owner and
	      group owner of the file as per the requirement. 
	    </p>
<h3>Access types or modes</h3>
<p>
	      Just specifying which user and which group should
	      have access to particular file may not be enough.
	      It may also be required to specify what type of
	      access (read, write or execute) should a
	      particular user have on a given file. 
	    </p>
<h3>Regular file permissions</h3>
<p>
	      Three different types of permissions can be
	      applied to regular files: read, write and execute
	      which are described below.
	    </p>
<dl>
<dt>read (r)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
		  Read permissions on a regular file (not a
		  directory) indicate that particular user or
		  members of the group are allowed to read the
		  file.  For example, if a user or a group has
		  read permissions on a text file then the user
		  or members of the group would be allowed to
		  see the contents of the text file using cat
		  command.  Read permissions are denoted by
		  alphabet 'r' and number '4' at various
		  occasions, hence Linux users should be
		  comfortable with using 'r' or '4' for
		  specifying read permissions as and when
		  required.
		</p>
</dd>
<dt>write (w)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
		  Write permissions on a regular file (not a
		  directory) indicate that particular user or
		  members of the group are allowed to write to
		  the file.  For example, if a user or a group
		  has write permissions on a text file then the
		  user or members of the group would be able to
		  modify the contents of the text file using vim
		  text editor.  Write permissions are denoted by
		  alphabet 'w' and number '2'.
		</p>
</dd>
<dt>execute (x)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
		  Execute permissions on a regular file (not a
		  directory) indicate that particular user or
		  members of the group are allowed to execute
		  (run) the file as a program.  Note that
		  execute permission may not make any sense on a
		  generic text file as execution of normal
		  language text is not defined. Thus, execute
		  permissions make sense only for scripts and
		  programs and not for every file.
		</p>
<p>
		  But Linux will not object if execute
		  permissions are assigned to some file which is
		  not a program such as an image file, and thus
		  cannot be executed.  Error message or
		  unexpected side-effects would be obtained
		  while attempting to run the image file but not
		  while assigning execute permissions to it.
		</p>
<p>
		  Thorough understanding of execute permissions
		  is not expected from beginner users right
		  away.  Hence do not worry if meaning of
		  execute permissions is not very clear.  It
		  requires some time to understand what
		  execute permissions mean. Execute
		  permissions are denoted by alphabet 'x' or
		  number '1' where ever required.
		</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	      Note that as part of this experiment words
	      'folder' and 'directory' are used interchangeably
	      and they both mean the same thing.
	    </p>
<h3>Directory or folder permissions</h3>
<p>
	      Similar to a regular file three different types
	      of permissions can be applied to a folder or
	      directory: read, write and execute.  But the
	      interpretation or significance of these
	      permissions for a directory is quite different
	      from that of a regular file. The explanation of
	      these different types of permissions for a
	      folder is described below:
	    </p>
<dl>
<dt>read (r)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
		  Read permissions on a directory (not a regular
		  file) indicate that particular user or members
		  of the group are allowed to list the contents
		  of the directory (read the directory).  For
		  example, if a user or a group has read
		  permissions on a directory then the user or
		  members of the group would be allowed to see
		  the contents of the directory using ls
		  command.  Same as in case of regular files,
		  read permissions for directories also are
		  denoted by alphabet 'r' or number '4'.
		</p>
</dd>
<dt>write (w)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
		  Write permissions on a directory (not a
		  regular file) indicate that particular user or
		  members of the group are allowed to create new
		  files inside the given directory.  For
		  example, if a user or a group has write
		  permissions on a directory then the user or
		  members of the group would be able to create
		  new files inside the directory using mkdir or
		  touch commands.  Moreover write permissions on
		  a directory also allow users to rename or
		  delete the files present inside the directory
		  using rmdir or rm command.  
		</p>
</dd>
<dt>execute (x)</dt>
<dd>
<p>
		  Execute permissions on a directory (not a
		  regular file) indicate that particular user or
		  members of the group are allowed to change
		  directory (cd) to given folder and also access
		  files inside the given folder.  If a user does
		  not has execute permissions on a folder, then
		  the user cannot access any file present inside
		  the folder.
		</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>
	      Sometimes it is desired for a file to have
	      specific (read, write or execute or their
	      combination) access by every user.  To satisfy
	      this type of requirement there is a special
	      category of user called others for each file.  
	      For every file everyone who is neither user
	      owner and nor a member of group owner for the
	      file belongs to other category for the file.  
	      This other category is very helpful in setting
	      the permissions on the file for everyone else
	      or the world or others.
	    </p>
<h3>Checking existing permissions and owner</h3>
<p>
	      To check existing permissions or owner on a
	      file one can use '<tt>ls -l</tt>'
	      command. Sample output of '<tt>ls -l</tt>'
	      command is shown below in Shell Output 1:
	    </p>
<pre class="code">
aditi@mylaptop:~/test$ ls -l     
total 8                                                                                      
drwxr-xr-x 2 aditi students 4096 Jan  1 09:15 dir1                                        
drwxr-xr-x 2 aditi students 4096 Jan  1 09:15 dir2                                        
-rw-r--r-- 1 aditi students    0 Jan  1 09:15 file1                                       
-rw-r--r-- 1 aditi students    0 Jan  1 09:15 file2    
aditi@mylaptop:~/test$
	    </pre>
<p style="text-align:center">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shell Output
		1:</span> Sample ls -l output
	    </p>
<p>
	      In Shell Output 1, ignoring the first line
	      (total 8) all other lines have seven
	      columns.  The first column in the output
	      indicates type of file and its
	      permissions.  For a regular file the first
	      character of first column is hypen('-')
	      whereas for a directory first character of
	      first column is alphabet 'd'.  
	    </p>
<p>
	      The next three characters after initial '-' or
	      'd' indicate read, write and execute
	      permissions for user owner for the given
	      file.  If a particular permission or type of
	      access is present then it is represented by
	      corresponding character such as 'r', 'w' or
	      'x'. However if a particular permission or
	      access is not present then a hypen('-')
	      character is displayed to indicate its
	      absence. 
	    </p>
<p>
	      Similarly, the next three characters
	      (characters 5 to 7) indicate read, write and
	      execute permissions for group which owns the
	      file and the last three characters (characters
	      8 to 10) indicate read, write and execute
	      permissions for others. The overall
	      significance and possible set of values for
	      each character position for first column of '<tt>ls
	      -l</tt>' output is explained in Table 3.

<h3>Changing file permissions</h3>
<p>
	      To change permissions of a file it is
	      necessary for user to be user owner of the
	      file.  Hence regular users cannot change
	      permissions of files which they do not own,
	      such as important operating system files or
	      files created by other users.  However, a
	      special user called superuser, often
	      recognized by username 'root', can change
	      ownership or permissions of any file on the
	      system.  This special user allows
	      administrators to manage the system
	      effectively, while ensuring security among
	      regular users.
	    </p>
<p>
	      To change the permissions of file owned by
	      same user, one can use '<tt>chmod</tt>'
	      command.  Many different methods of invocation
	      supported by chmod are explained in next few
	      sections.
	    </p>
<h3>Using alphabets u,g,o,a and r,w,x for
	    changing permissions</h3>
<p>
	      One of the ways of using chmod is to use
	      alphabets such as u,g,o,a or r,w,x for
	      representing user, group, others, all or read,
	      write, execute and then change the appropriate
	      permissions.  Syntax for using chmod in this
	      manner, significance of each alphabet or
	      symbols and related examples are mentioned
	      below.

<h3>Using numeric permissions (ex 755, 700, 555
	    etc.)</h3>
<p>
	      Very often the need is to assign exact
	      permissions to a file ignoring its current
	      permissions.  In such cases instead of using
	      alphabets as shown before often numbers are
	      used to specify the permissions for a
	      file.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Numeric permissions are specified using three
	      digit octal numbers.  The first octal digit
	      represents exact permissions for user owner,
	      the second octal digit represents exact
	      permissions for group owner and last octal
	      digit represents exact permissions for
	      others. 
	    </p>
<p>
	      Octal digit for a particular category is
	      obtained by adding numeric representations of
	      desired permissions.  For example if both
	      read(4) and write(2) permissions are desired
	      for a given category, but not execute(1) then
	      octal permission for the category would be
	      4+2=6. Similarly if only execute permissions
	      are desired and not read or write then octal
	      permission would be 1.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Various types of octal permissions and their
	      usage is explained with help of Table 5 and
	      Shell Output 4 below.

<p style="text-align:center">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shell Output
		4:</span> Various invocations of '<tt>chmod</tt>'
	      using numeric permissions.
	    </p>
<h3>Example 1: Requirement 3</h3>
<p>
	      Consider requirement of Example 1 where file
	      students.txt should be editable (read, write)
	      by principal, should be readable by teachers
	      and should not be readable, writable or
	      executable by students. 
	    </p>
<p>
	      To satisfy this requirement principal can be
	      made user owner for file students.txt.  Then
	      group owner of the file students.txt can be
	      set to teachers user-group.  Then finally 640
	      permissions can be set on students.txt using
	      '<tt>chmod 640 students.txt</tt>' command.
	      This would ensure that all the constraints
	      specified in requirement 3 are satisfied.
	    </p>
<h3>Example 1: Requirement 4</h3>
<p>
	      Consider another requirement of Example 1
	      where all the teachers should have read, write
	      permissions on marks.txt and all students
	      should have read permissions on
	      marks.txt. Also in this case the principal
	      should not have any permission read or write
	      on marks.txt. 
	    </p>
<p>
	      Now this complex
	      requirement <span style="font-weight:bold">
	      cannot </span> be satisfied using user, groups
	      and permissions supported by Linux in any
	      reasonably good way.  This is because we have
	      separate set of permissions are required for
	      two different groups students and teachers
	      which the current permission system cannot
	      account for.  We cannot assign permissions to
	      others in this case as that would end up
	      applying to principal too, which is against
	      the mentioned requirements. Hence, this
	      specific example has been put intentionally to
	      explain that not all types of requirements can
	      be satisfied with Linux file permissions.
	    </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
	      This section concludes the theory part of the
	      experiment.  Few details related to chmod such
	      as fourth octal digit for permissions, setuid,
	      setgid, sticky-bit etc. are intentionally
	      omitted to avoid unnecessary complexities.
	      Interested users can refer to '<tt>man
	      chmod</tt>' and other reading material
	      suggested in Further Reading section for
	      further information.
